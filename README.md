# PERMAFROST Vault

Post-quantum multisig vault for [OPNet](https://opnet.org) Bitcoin L1 smart contracts.

PERMAFROST Vault is a self-hosted application that combines distributed key generation (DKG), threshold ML-DSA signing, wallet management, and OPNet transaction broadcasting into a single interface. T-of-N parties each produce their own secret share of an ML-DSA (post-quantum) signing key — without any single party ever seeing the full secret.

## How it works

### Key generation (DKG ceremony)

1. **One party creates** a session (choosing T, N, and security level).
2. **Other parties join** by pasting the session code.
3. The ceremony runs **four phases** (Commit, Reveal, Masks, Aggregate), exchanging blobs between all parties.
4. When complete, each party **downloads their encrypted share file** and independently verifies the combined public key.

### Signing

1. One party builds a transaction (contract, method, parameters) and the vault encodes it into calldata.
2. Each signing party **loads their share file** and enters their password.
3. The signing protocol runs **three rounds** of blob exchange, then combines the partial responses into a standard FIPS 204 ML-DSA signature.
4. One party **broadcasts** the signed transaction to the OPNet network. The server prevents double-broadcast — other parties see the confirmed result.

### Blob exchange

Both DKG and signing support two modes:

- **Relay mode** — an encrypted WebSocket relay routes E2E encrypted messages between parties in real time. The relay is built into the container.
- **Offline mode** — parties manually copy/paste blobs (air-gapped friendly).

## Install

### Linux (one command)

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/mwaddip/otzi/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

Downloads the latest release, creates systemd services, and configures
nginx or apache if detected. Works with or without sudo — without sudo it
installs to `~/.permafrost/` with user-level services.

### Debian/Ubuntu (.deb)

```bash
curl -sLO https://github.com/mwaddip/otzi/releases/latest/download/permafrost-vault_*.deb
sudo dpkg -i permafrost-vault_*.deb
```

Installs to `/opt/permafrost/`, creates system user, configures nginx,
and prompts for port and domain via debconf.

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -v permafrost-data:/data ghcr.io/mwaddip/otzi:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwaddip/otzi && cd otzi && docker compose up -d
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwaddip/otzi && cd otzi
sudo ./install.sh --deps     # install Node 20 + Go 1.23
sudo ./install.sh --build    # build and install as systemd services
```

### Windows

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/mwaddip/otzi/releases/latest)
zip, extract, and run `start.bat`. Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in
your PATH. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### Installer options

#### Ports

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **80** | Caddy | HTTP — serves the frontend and proxies `/api` + `/ws` to the backend |
| **443** | Caddy | HTTPS — active when a domain is configured with Let's Encrypt |
| **8080** | Backend | Direct access (bypasses Caddy) |

#### Custom domain and HTTPS

The Docker image includes [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) with automatic
Let's Encrypt HTTPS. Configure from **Settings > Hosting** in the UI, or:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/hosting \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"domain": "vault.example.com", "httpsEnabled": true}'
```

#### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Backend HTTP port |
| `RELAY_PORT` | `8081` | Internal relay WebSocket port |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Persistent data directory |
| `CADDYFILE_PATH` | `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` | Caddy configuration file |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | `/data/caddy` | Caddy certificate/data storage |

</details>

### Storage modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Persistent** | Config stored as plaintext JSON. For trusted environments. |
| **Encrypted Persistent** | Config encrypted with AES-256-GCM on disk. Password required on each restart. |
| **Encrypted Portable** | Config lives only in server memory. Admin downloads an encrypted backup and re-uploads it on each new server session. Nothing is ever written to disk. |

#### Portable mode in practice

Portable mode is the most paranoid option — keys never touch the server filesystem — but it has trade-offs you should understand before choosing it.

**How it works:**

- After the install wizard, the entire vault config (wallet, DKG shares, contracts, manifest, users) lives in the server process's memory.
- Once initialized, the instance **stays loaded and fully operational** for as long as the server process keeps running. Joiners can connect, ceremonies can run, transactions can be signed and broadcast — all without restarting or re-uploading anything.
- When the server is **rebooted, restarted, redeployed, or nuked**, the in-memory config is wiped. The next visitor sees the install wizard.
- To recover, the admin restores from their encrypted backup file via the wizard's **Restore from Backup** option.

**Critical workflow:**

1. Complete the install wizard with **Encrypted Portable** selected.
2. Generate a wallet (or skip).
3. Run the DKG ceremony.
4. **Download the encrypted config** when the orange banner appears at the top of the page. The banner stays visible on every page until you click it. This file is your only persistent copy of everything.
5. Store the `.enc` file somewhere safe (multiple copies recommended).
6. Use the instance normally. After any meaningful change (new contract, manifest update, added user), download a fresh backup from **Settings > Backup**.
7. If the server ever restarts, visit the URL → **Restore from Backup** on the wizard → upload your `.enc` file → enter the password.

**How joiners experience portable mode:**

- In **password auth mode**, joiners need no password to participate in signing — they just visit the URL and load their share file. The admin password only gates admin operations.
- In **wallet auth mode**, joiners authenticate via OPWallet or use a `?session=CODE` URL the admin shares for a single ceremony.
- In both modes, joiners can only connect while the admin's config is loaded in memory. If the server has restarted and the admin hasn't restored yet, joiners see the install wizard.

## Development

Run three processes in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend (Vite dev server on :5173)
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Backend (Express on :8080)
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 3: Relay (Go on :8081, needed for relay mode)
npm run dev:relay
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the backend on port 8080.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Go 1.23+

### Offline build

```bash
npm run build:offline
```

Produces a self-contained HTML file in `dist-offline/` that runs from `file://` with zero network dependency. Useful for air-gapped DKG ceremonies.

## Security

- **Post-quantum signatures**: ML-DSA (FIPS 204) via threshold signing — no single party holds the full key.
- **E2E relay encryption**: All relay messages encrypted with ECDH (P-256) + AES-256-GCM. The relay server only forwards ciphertext.
- **Share file encryption**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-derived key (600k iterations, SHA-256).
- **Blob integrity**: DKG phase 3 blobs include SHA-256 checksums and polynomial coefficient range validation.
- **Canonical ordering**: Signing rounds enforce deterministic party ordering to prevent protocol divergence.
- **Broadcast locking**: Server-side lock prevents double-broadcast of the same transaction.
- **No secrets on server**: The relay holds no cryptographic material. Share passwords never leave the browser.

## Project Manifests

Any OPNet project can plug into Otzi by writing a `.otzi.json` manifest file — no custom code needed. The manifest declares contracts, operations, live state reads, conditional visibility, and optional theming. Otzi imports it and renders a fully functional operations interface with threshold signing and broadcasting built in.

### Quick example

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "My Token",
  "contracts": {
    "token": { "label": "MyToken", "abi": "OP_20" }
  },
  "reads": {
    "supply": { "contract": "token", "method": "totalSupply", "returns": "uint256", "format": "token8" }
  },
  "status": [
    { "label": "Total Supply", "read": "supply" }
  ],
  "operations": [
    {
      "id": "transfer",
      "label": "Transfer",
      "contract": "token",
      "method": "transfer",
      "params": [
        { "name": "to", "type": "address", "label": "Recipient" },
        { "name": "amount", "type": "uint256", "label": "Amount", "scale": 1e8 }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Save as `my-token.otzi.json`, import in **Settings > Project Manifest**, configure the contract address, and you're signing and broadcasting transactions through threshold ML-DSA.

### What manifests can do

- **Contracts** — define any number of contracts with custom ABIs or built-in shorthands (`OP_20`, `OP_721`)
- **State reads** — poll contract values on a timer with format hints (token amounts, BTC values, percentages, prices)
- **Status panel** — dashboard showing live contract state with optional value-to-label mapping
- **Operations** — parameter inputs with auto-fill from contract addresses, settings, or live reads; scale multipliers for decimal tokens; confirmation prompts for destructive actions
- **Conditions** — show/hide operations based on contract state (equality, comparison, block windows, boolean combinators)
- **Theme** — override accent color, background, and border radius to match your project's branding

### Schema

The full JSON Schema is at [`docs/otzi-manifest-schema.json`](docs/otzi-manifest-schema.json). Use it to validate manifests or as a reference for all available fields.

### Import flow

1. Go to **Settings > Project Manifest > Import .otzi.json**
2. Select your manifest file
3. Configure contract addresses for each contract key
4. Save — operations appear on the main signing page
