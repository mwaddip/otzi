# PERMAFROST Vault

Post-quantum multisig vault for [OPNet](https://opnet.org) Bitcoin L1 smart contracts.

PERMAFROST Vault is a self-hosted Docker container that combines distributed key generation (DKG), threshold ML-DSA signing, wallet management, and OPNet transaction broadcasting into a single interface. T-of-N parties each produce their own secret share of an ML-DSA (post-quantum) signing key — without any single party ever seeing the full secret.

## How it works

### Key generation (DKG ceremony)

1. **One party creates** a session (choosing T, N, and security level).
2. **Other parties join** by pasting the session code.
3. The ceremony runs **four phases** (Commit, Reveal, Masks, Aggregate), exchanging blobs between all parties.
4. When complete, each party **downloads their encrypted share file** and independently verifies the combined public key.

### Signing

1. One party builds a transaction (contract, method, parameters) and the vault encodes it into calldata.
2. Each signing party **loads their share file** and enters their password.
3. The signing protocol runs **three rounds** of blob exchange, then combines the partial responses into a standard FIPS 204 ML-DSA signature.
4. One party **broadcasts** the signed transaction to the OPNet network. The server prevents double-broadcast — other parties see the confirmed result.

### Blob exchange

Both DKG and signing support two modes:

- **Relay mode** — an encrypted WebSocket relay routes E2E encrypted messages between parties in real time. The relay is built into the container.
- **Offline mode** — parties manually copy/paste blobs (air-gapped friendly).

## Docker deployment

### Quick start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open **http://localhost** — the install wizard guides you through network selection, storage mode, wallet generation, and the DKG ceremony.

### Build from source

```bash
docker build -t permafrost-vault .
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -v permafrost-data:/data \
  permafrost-vault
```

### Ports

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **80** | Caddy | HTTP — serves the frontend and proxies `/api` + `/ws` to the backend |
| **443** | Caddy | HTTPS — active when a domain is configured with Let's Encrypt |
| **8080** | Backend | Direct access (bypasses Caddy) |

### Custom domain and HTTPS

The container includes [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy with automatic Let's Encrypt HTTPS. Configure it from **Settings > Hosting** in the UI, or via the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/hosting \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"domain": "vault.example.com", "httpsEnabled": true}'
```

When HTTPS is enabled, Caddy automatically obtains and renews a TLS certificate. Ports 80 and 443 must be reachable from the internet for the ACME challenge.

### Storage modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Persistent** | Config stored as plaintext JSON at `/data/config.json`. For trusted environments. |
| **Encrypted Persistent** | Config encrypted with AES-256-GCM on disk. Password required on each container restart. |
| **Encrypted Portable** | Config downloaded to your machine. Upload + password each session. Nothing stored on the server. |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8080` | Backend HTTP port |
| `RELAY_PORT` | `8081` | Internal relay WebSocket port |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Persistent data directory |
| `CADDYFILE_PATH` | `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` | Caddy configuration file |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | `/data/caddy` | Caddy certificate/data storage |

## Development

Run three processes in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend (Vite dev server on :5173)
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Backend (Express on :8080)
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 3: Relay (Go on :8081, needed for relay mode)
npm run dev:relay
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` to the backend on port 8080.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Go 1.23+

### Offline build

```bash
npm run build:offline
```

Produces a self-contained HTML file in `dist-offline/` that runs from `file://` with zero network dependency. Useful for air-gapped DKG ceremonies.

## Security

- **Post-quantum signatures**: ML-DSA (FIPS 204) via threshold signing — no single party holds the full key.
- **E2E relay encryption**: All relay messages encrypted with ECDH (P-256) + AES-256-GCM. The relay server only forwards ciphertext.
- **Share file encryption**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2-derived key (600k iterations, SHA-256).
- **Blob integrity**: DKG phase 3 blobs include SHA-256 checksums and polynomial coefficient range validation.
- **Canonical ordering**: Signing rounds enforce deterministic party ordering to prevent protocol divergence.
- **Broadcast locking**: Server-side lock prevents double-broadcast of the same transaction.
- **No secrets on server**: The relay holds no cryptographic material. Share passwords never leave the browser.
